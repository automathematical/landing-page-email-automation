# âœ¨ Landing Page Email Auto-Responder (n8n)

---

This project is a **fully automated workflow** built with [n8n](https://n8n.io), designed to improve the onboarding experience for new email signups through a landing page.

When someone signs up, this automation kicks in and sends a personalized welcome email and a slack message with the signup info â€” no manual work required.
